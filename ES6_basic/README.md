# ES6 Basics Project

## ðŸ“– Project Presentation
This project introduces the fundamental concepts of **ECMAScript 6 (ES6)**, the modern standard of JavaScript.  
The goal is to understand and practice the key improvements that ES6 brought to the language, making JavaScript more powerful, concise, and easier to read.  

Throughout 13 tasks, you will explore variables, scoping, arrow functions, default parameters, spread/rest syntax, template literals, object property shorthand, computed properties, method properties, iterators, and object manipulation.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Differentiate between `const`, `let`, and `var`
- Understand block scoping
- Use arrow functions effectively
- Work with default parameters
- Apply spread and rest syntax
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Simplify object creation with shorthand syntax
- Dynamically set property names with computed properties
- Define methods using ES6 method shorthand
- Use `for...of` loops for cleaner iteration
- Create and manipulate objects with iterators
- Build structured objects with nested properties and methods

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Const or let?
Modify functions to use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.

### Task 1: Block Scope
Refactor code so that variables are not overwritten inside a conditional block using block-scoped variables.

### Task 2: Arrow functions
Rewrite a function to use ES6 arrow function syntax.

### Task 3: Parameter defaults
Simplify a function by using default parameter values directly in its signature.

### Task 4: Rest parameter syntax for functions
Modify a function so it can return the number of arguments passed, using rest parameter syntax (`...args`).

### Task 5: The wonders of spread syntax
Concatenate two arrays and expand a string into an array of characters using spread syntax.

### Task 6: Take advantage of template literals
Rewrite a concatenated string using template literals and variable interpolation.

### Task 7: Object property value shorthand syntax
Simplify object creation by using ES6 shorthand when the property name matches the variable name.

### Task 8: No need to create empty objects before adding in properties
Use ES6 computed property names to create an object with dynamic keys.

### Task 9: ES6 method properties
Refactor functions inside an object to use the ES6 method shorthand syntax.

### Task 10: For...of Loops
Rewrite a loop using the ES6 `for...of` syntax to iterate through array values.

### Task 11: Iterator
Create a function that returns an object where the key is the department name and the value is an array of employees.

### Task 12: Let's create a report object
Build an object containing all employees grouped by department, with an additional method to count departments.

### Task 13: Iterating through report objects
(Extension of task 12) Create a function to iterate through the report object and display its data in a structured way.

## âœ… Conclusion
This project is designed to help you practice and master the **core ES6 features** that are essential for modern JavaScript development.  
By completing these 13 tasks, you will gain practical experience with syntax improvements and new capabilities that make JavaScript more robust, readable, and developer-friendly.
