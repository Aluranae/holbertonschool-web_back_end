# NoSQL

## ðŸ“Œ Project Presentation
This project introduces the integration of **MongoDB** with **Python**.  
It focuses on using the `pymongo` driver to interact with MongoDB databases, retrieve, insert, update, and manipulate data, while respecting the requirements of Holberton School projects.  

The project follows a progressive learning path, where each task builds on the previous one to consolidate your skills with databases and Python scripting.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of **NoSQL** and **MongoDB**.
- Use **MongoDB shell** commands to manage collections and documents.
- Perform CRUD operations (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`) with `pymongo`.
- Write efficient **queries** to filter documents.
- Handle **insertions**, **updates**, and **deletions** programmatically.
- Extract specific **statistics** from a MongoDB collection.
- Use Python scripts to automate MongoDB operations.

## ðŸ“‚ Tasks Overview

### **Task 0: List Databases**
Write a Python script that lists all databases in MongoDB.

---

### **Task 1: Create a Collection**
Create a function that inserts a new document in a collection based on keyword arguments.

---

### **Task 2: Insert Document**
Implement a Python function to insert a new document into a MongoDB collection.

---

### **Task 3: List Documents**
Write a function that lists all documents in a collection.

---

### **Task 4: Match by Name**
Create a function that retrieves a document based on the value of `name`.

---

### **Task 5: Count Documents**
Write a function that returns the number of documents in a collection.

---

### **Task 6: Update Topics**
Implement a function that changes all topics of a school document based on the school name.

---

### **Task 7: Delete by Match**
Write a function that deletes all documents with a specific `name`.

---

### **Task 8: List All Students**
Write a Python function that lists all students and their average score.

---

### **Task 9: Top Students**
Implement a function that returns all students sorted by their average score.

---

### **Task 10: Log Stats**
Write a Python script that provides statistics about Nginx logs stored in MongoDB.

---

### **Task 11: More Log Stats**
Enhance the previous script to include additional details about Nginx logs.

---

### **Task 12: Log Stats (Advanced)**
Write a Python script that displays extended statistics about Nginx logs, including methods count and status checks.

---

### **Task 13: Regex Filter (Bonus)**
Write a script that filters logs in MongoDB using a regular expression.

---

## âœ… Final Notes
This project consolidates your ability to:
- Use **MongoDB in real-world use cases**.
- Write Python scripts that interact seamlessly with databases.
- Extract meaningful insights from data collections.

By completing all tasks, you will be prepared to use **NoSQL databases** in larger back-end and full-stack projects.
